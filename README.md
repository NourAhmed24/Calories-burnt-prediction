Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸ”¥
Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the number of calories a person burns during physical activity. The model is trained on a dataset containing various fitness-related features, such as heart rate, body temperature, and duration of exercise. This tool can be used by fitness enthusiasts or health professionals to get an estimated calorie expenditure based on their workout data.
Features

    Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, scales features, and prepares the data for model training.

    Model Training: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., a Gradient Boosting Regressor or a Random Forest Regressor) on the provided dataset.

    Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict calories burned based on new input data.

    Performance Evaluation: Reports key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score to assess the model's accuracy.

Technologies Used

    Python: The core programming language for the project.

    Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    NumPy: For numerical operations.

    Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization (optional, but recommended for EDA).


Dataset

This project uses a dataset containing various features such as User_ID, Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duration (of activity), Heart_Rate, Body_Temp, and Calories (the target variable).
